## Previous work and their problems
There are about three types of voting systems: **paper-based, direct-recording electronic(DRE) and online**
The problems with the paper-based was that there was wastage of paper and material and the labor work. The problem with the online voting system is mainly ***security***; security of the system, the users and the votes. In order to solve these, we need to have user authentiaction and make sure a user can only vote once and build a more secure voting system.
